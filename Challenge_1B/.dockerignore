# Project-specific large files/folders that should NOT be part of the Docker image.
# We are mounting PDFs at runtime, so they should NOT be copied into the image.
# If your PDFs are in a folder named 'PDFs', uncomment the line below:
# PDFs/

# If you have any other large data folders that are meant for runtime mounting,
# or are just source data, add them here:
# data/
# raw_data/
# notebooks/
# results/
# output/
# logs/
# temp/

# Docker build related files (these are handled by Docker itself and should not be copied into the context)
